The task implements the main functions from the test assignment. On the homepage, there is a list of countries on the left where you can see the list of holidays for the current year, and on the right, there are 3 random countries showing the upcoming holidays. A country search function is available. If you click on a country, a list of holidays for that specific country is displayed, with the option to select the year, as stated in the assignment.

The project consists of two simple pages: the homepage and a specific country page. There wasnâ€™t enough time for additional features since the project wasn't started immediately. User errors, such as incorrect paths, are only handled using the default Nuxt.js tools.

An additional library that was used is Moment.js.
